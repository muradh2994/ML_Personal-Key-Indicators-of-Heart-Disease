**Conclusion:**

According to decision tree, the most important features which might impact the heart disease are Difficulty in Walking, Diabetis, Old age (age >75). As per the heat map,The difficulty in walking is directly correalted with physical health and it is also impacting the heart disease. Moreover, machine learning also derives that American Indian/ Alaskan Native suffers the most due to heart disease.Although more researches could be make to ascertain the key variables.
